PURPOSE
    I own a digital still camera which generates Jpeg files. The camera's
    user interface allows to flag the pictures as being rotated 90°, a mean
    to indicate that their top left corner should be considered as the top
    right, without actually rotating the file. I use this flag to generate
    HTML galleries that can be seen without the need to bend your neck,
    while keeping the original Jpeg files untouched.

    Unfortunately, I often forget to flag the Orientation of the Jpeg files
    while they are still in the digital camera, and I end up with files on
    my hard drive that are wrongly marked as being "landscape" while they
    are indeed "portrait". So I need a tool to correct this.

    And while I was at it, I enabled the tool to edit the comments within
    the Jpeg files, so that the HTML gallery generator need not read an
    extra file to know what title to display with what image.

DEPENDANCIES
    This program is written in Perl/Tk and uses a couple of non-standard
    Perl modules, all freely available from your local CPAN mirror
    (http://www.cpan.org).

    perl 5.6.1 or higher
    Tk
    Tk::JPEG
    Image::MetaData::JPEG

    Whenever possible, thumbnail images are extracted from the bigger Jpeg
    file itself. When they're not available, the program uses ImageMagick to
    resize the image and turn it into a thumbnail. Therefore, you must
    install ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org), and its Perl API
    PerlMagick: Image::Magick.

INSTALLATION
    Make sure you have Perl, ImageMagick and all the necessary modules
    installed properly.

    Then copy the file bin/editphotos to some directory in you path, e.g.,
    /usr/local/bin.

    You can optionally generate the man page:

        pod2man --section=1 /usr/local/bin/editphotos > /usr/local/man/man1/editphotos.1

BUGS
    This is my first try at Tk in Perl. There's bound to be bugs in this
    program. Let me know if you find any and thank you for giving it a try.
